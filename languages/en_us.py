#First of all thank you for your interest in translating this game, 
#I will be grateful if you could share it with the community - 
#if possible please send it back to my email, and I'll add it to the next version.

#The translation does not have to be exact as long as it makes sense and fits in its location 
#(if it doesn't I'll try to either make the font smaller or make the area wider - where possible). 
#The color names in other languages than English are already in smaller font.

#when translating the "d" dictionary please translate the values
#and leave keys as they are (the keys are sometimes shortened to save on space)

#Example in German:
# - d["Welcome back."] = "Welcome back in the game."
# + d["Welcome back."] = "Willkommen zur√ºck im Spiel."
